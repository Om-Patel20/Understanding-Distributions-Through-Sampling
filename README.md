# Understanding-Distributions-Through-Sampling

To complete this assignment, create a code cell that:
  -> Creates a number of subplots using the pyplot subplots or matplotlib gridspec functionality.
  -> Creates an animation, pulling between 100 and 1000 samples from each of the random variables (x1, x2, x3, x4) for each plot and plotting this as we did in the lecture on animation.
  -> Bonus: Go above and beyond and "wow" your classmates (and me!) by looking into matplotlib widgets and adding a widget which allows for parameterization of the distributions behind the sampling animations.
